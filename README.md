# Pypass
Alternative to [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) and to Byparr.
Since lately none of those was working, I tried to write something on my own.
It turned out that Byparr was a great start, so thank you [@ThePhaseless](https://github.com/ThePhaseless) :heart:

# How to use it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kopolindo/pypass
docker compose up -d
```
